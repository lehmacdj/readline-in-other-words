This package provides a few [in-other-words](https://github.com/KingoftheHomeless/in-other-words#readme) effects that collectively provide the full functionality of [haskeline](https://github.com/judah/haskeline#readme). See Haskeline's documentation for additional usage information.

## echo-repl
A small example `echo-repl` is provided with this package to demonstrate basic
usage. It will echo whatever text you write, and announce that an interrupt
occurred when one happens.
